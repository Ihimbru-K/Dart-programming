/*
we create a class called BinaryNode that has three properties: 
value, leftChild, and rightChild. 
The value property stores the value of the node and the leftChild 
and rightChild properties store references to the left and right child nodes respectively.
You can use this class to create a binary tree by creating instances of the BinaryNode class 
and setting their leftChild and rightChild properties as needed.
