Abstraction is a concept in object-oriented programming that allows us to
hide implementation details and only show the necessary features of an object. 
In Dart, we can implement abstraction using abstract classes and interfaces.

In this example, the Animal class is an abstract class that defines the makeSound() method. 
The Dog and Cat classes both implement the Animal class and provide their own implementation of the makeSound() method.
