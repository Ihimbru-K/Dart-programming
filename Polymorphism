class Animal {
  void makeSound() {
    print('Animal sound');
  }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
  void makeSound() {
    print('Bark!');
  }
}

class Cat extends Animal {
  void makeSound() {
    print('Meow!');
  }
}

/
In this example, 
the Dog and Cat classes both inherit from the Animal class. 
They both have a makeSound() method that overrides the makeSound() method of the Animal class. T
his allows us to treat objects of the Dog and Cat classes as if they were objects of the Animal class.
